Nagarro Interview ---- Coding Test Online :
Three Problems in 90 min
1.We have variable declarations naming conventions for two Languages c++ and Java.
Suppose for 'Employe Department Details' naming variable name 
In java is   'employeDepartmentDetails'
In c++ is 'employe_department_details'.
Please add lines in method as below which will convert variable name based on language.

String covertLanguageVarible(String NameVaribleInput){
//lines in method which will convert variable name based on language.
return NameVaribleInput;
}

Test Case 1:
Input :employeDepartmentDetails
OutPut:employe_department_details

Test Case 2:
Input :jai_mata_di
OutPut:jaiMataDi


2.Please add lines in method as below which will display frequency of all characters in string typr input.

String covertFreqString(String dataItemInput){
//lines in method which will display frequency of all characters in string typr input.
return dataItemInput;
}

Test Case 1:
Input :amnqmamananqm
OutPut:a4m4n3q2

Test Case 2:
Input :bdbcdbcbc
OutPut:b4c3d2

3.Soppose we have two inputs for method :1)input1 int type 2) input2 int array type.
Please add lines in method as below which will display element with frequency  in array input2 if frquency of a 
element from array input2 is greater than half of input1 otherwise display -1.

int freqStringDataInput(int input1,int input2){
//lines in method which will display frequency of all characters in string typr input.
return -1;
}

Test Case 1:
->Input:
Input1 :7
Input2 :{2,8,2,3,2,2,2}
->OutPut:2 5

Explanations array's element 2's frequency is 5 . Half of input1 is 7/2=3.5.
And therefore, frequency value 5 is greater than Half of input1 [3.5] and therefore output is 2 5


Test Case 2:
->Input:
Input1 :8
Input2 :{2,8,2,3,2,5,4,6}
->OutPut:-1
Explanations array's element 2's frequency is 3 . Half of input1 is 4.
And therefore, frequency value not greater than Half of input1 and therefore output is -1


Test Case 3:
->Input:
Input1 :8
Input2 :{2,9,2,3,2,5,4,2}
->OutPut:-1

Explanations array's element 2's frequency is 4 . Half of input1 is 4.
And therefore, frequency value not greater than Half of input1 and therefore output is -1
